# FreakyVille-TradePrices

This repository holds a Formatted list of commonplace trading prices on the minecraft server FreakyVille.
The prices are from a set of google sheets documents created and maintained by the FreakyVille trademarket community.

These prices are just formatted in a way that makes them easier to use when coding.

The specific csv file in this repository is maintained by me.
